			Below is a series of links to problems, each problem is an HTML file that contains the explaination of the problem as well as a partial solution.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please complete the HTML/CSS/JavaScript code in the problem file in order to solve it and send the completed code back to us to review.  Feel free to put comments in the HTML file to explain your solution. Also <b>PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY THIRD PARTY LIBRARIES</b> to complete these.
		</p>
		<p>
			One thing to keep in mind here is that these are fairly open-ended for a reason. We want to see your creativity and style, there is plenty of room for finesse, so please feel free to use it. Also these things shouldn't take you longer than a few hours, so please don't feel like you need to spend a day on it.

				<p>I took a balanced approach: kept it clean, maintanable, and usable.  The Tabs and Image Rotator are actually the same code (just styled differently).  The door is open for future customizations :)</p>

				<h4 class="top">CSS3 Character Animation</h4>
				<p>A small snippet of a proof-of-concept for (skeletal) animation of a game character.</p>
				<p>My first instinct was sprite animation, but wanted to test the waters with CSS3 animation.  Was great fun! And is great IF the style of the game can match the limitations of the animation (no dynamic movement).</p>

				<h4 class="top">Do You Like Comics?</h4>
				<p>A little left-field, but I'm hoping you are a company that likes that!  This was a comic I did as a personal project - and I'm very proud of it.  I'm a massive fan of black &amp; white comics, and wanted to try something outside of my comfort zone.</p>

			<div id="tab-4" class="tab-pane">
				<h4 class="top">Zombies!</h4>
				<p>This was a proof-of-concept after someone had asked me "can you make me a game?".  I loved the idea of trying!  Now performance is a dog, and it is very rough, but it explores things like line-of-sight, pathfinding, tracking, orientation, acheivements, animation, etc.</p>

				<p>click zombies to shoot at them.  To move, click hero, then click destination tile.</p>

				<h4 class="top">DOM Game Experiment</h4>
				<p>A game idea with a turn-based concept in mind (I'm an X-COM fan)</p>
				<p>Unfortunately this one is a not even a playable demo, more of a code brain-dump.  I included it though to share with fellow front-end developers -  have a peek at the code to see how I was approaching the concept!  For everyone else ... nothing to see here.</p>
				<p>Please be gentle, this is the equivalent to a sketch book :)</p>
