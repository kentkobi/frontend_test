		<p>
			Below is a series of links to problems, each problem is an HTML file that contains the explaination of the problem as well as a partial solution.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please complete the HTML/CSS/JavaScript code in the problem file in order to solve it and send the completed code back to us to review.  Feel free to put comments in the HTML file to explain your solution. Also <b>PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY THIRD PARTY LIBRARIES</b> to complete these.
		</p>
		<p>
			One thing to keep in mind here is that these are fairly open-ended for a reason. We want to see your creativity and style, there is plenty of room for finesse, so please feel free to use it. Also these things shouldn't take you longer than a few hours, so please don't feel like you need to spend a day on it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Have fun, show off, and please give us feedback so we can make this better!

				<a href="http://kentkobi.com/zombies/">BONUS: (rough) proof-of-concept for game idea</a>
				<p>for fun: playing around with a game idea (chrome or Firefox only).  click zomibies to shoot at them.  click hero, then click tile to move.  Performance is a dog.  Explores things like line-of-sight, pathfinding, tracking, orientation, animation, etc.</p>

				<a href="https://github.com/kentkobi/sponge">BONUS: github repo of html5 game experiment</a>
				<p>for fun: another game idea with turn-based concept in mind (chrome or Firefox only).  This one is a not even a demo, more of a brain-dump.  However, a peek at the code can show how I was approaching the concept!  Only fellow front-end developers will find this even remotely interesting :)</p>
